https://youtu.be/KRj4DFBTBkA?si=egMkDz49KeR-eAjB

i think when you see the video you will understand

## Game's Structure

you will have to get 10 images 

duplicate every images in html 

every two images give them an attribute and a unique value 

then take the images in js and shuffle them then append it in html again

make the back of the cord 

make all cards flip 

give to them add event listener click 

wait until he chose two cards 

check if they are right 

if right make it showed to the user until the end 

if not make a error sound and flip it again 
to be a good game add tries every times he get this wrong add 1 to it 
check in every loop if he end the game or not 
-- note probably will have to use set time out
